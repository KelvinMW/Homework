To create the "Homework" module in PHP for GibbonEdu, we will follow these steps:

1. Create the necessary database table to store homework assignments.
2. Create the core classes and functions for the module.
3. Implement the user interface for teachers to manage homework assignments.
4. Integrate the module with GibbonEdu.
5. Save the data in the same table as GibbonEdu Planner.

Let's start by creating the necessary database table.

**1. Create the database table**

We will create a table named `gibbonHomework` to store the homework assignments. The table will have the following fields:

- `id`: The unique identifier for each homework assignment.
- `subject`: The subject of the homework assignment.
- `dueDate`: The due date of the homework assignment.
- `description`: The description of the homework assignment.
- `instructions`: Any additional instructions for the homework assignment.
- `classID`: The ID of the class or group to which the homework assignment is assigned.

Create a new file named `create_homework_table.php` and add the following code:

```php
<?php

// Include the Gibbon database connection
require_once 'gibbon.php';

// Create the homework table
$createTableSQL = "
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `gibbonHomework` (
    `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
    `subject` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    `dueDate` DATE NOT NULL,
    `description` TEXT NOT NULL,
    `instructions` TEXT,
    `classID` INT(11) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
";

$pdo->exec($createTableSQL);
```

Next, let's create the core classes and functions for the module.

**2. Core Classes and Functions**

We will create the following core classes and functions for the "Homework" module:

- `Homework`: The main class that handles the functionality of the module.
- `HomeworkAssignment`: A data class representing a homework assignment.
- `HomeworkManager`: A class responsible for managing the homework assignments.

Create a new file named `Homework.php` and add the following code:

```php
<?php

class HomeworkAssignment {
    public $id;
    public $subject;
    public $dueDate;
    public $description;
    public $instructions;
    public $classID;
}

class HomeworkManager {
    private $pdo;

    public function __construct($pdo) {
        $this->pdo = $pdo;
    }

    public function createHomeworkAssignment($assignment) {
        // TODO: Implement the logic to create a new homework assignment
    }

    public function updateHomeworkAssignment($assignment) {
        // TODO: Implement the logic to update an existing homework assignment
    }

    public function deleteHomeworkAssignment($id) {
        // TODO: Implement the logic to delete a homework assignment
    }

    public function getHomeworkAssignments($classID) {
        // TODO: Implement the logic to retrieve homework assignments for a specific class
    }
}

class Homework {
    private $manager;

    public function __construct($pdo) {
        $this->manager = new HomeworkManager($pdo);
    }

    public function createHomeworkAssignment($assignment) {
        $this->manager->createHomeworkAssignment($assignment);
    }

    public function updateHomeworkAssignment($assignment) {
        $this->manager->updateHomeworkAssignment($assignment);
    }

    public function deleteHomeworkAssignment($id) {
        $this->manager->deleteHomeworkAssignment($id);
    }

    public function getHomeworkAssignments($classID) {
        return $this->manager->getHomeworkAssignments($classID);
    }
}
```

Now, let's implement the user interface for teachers to manage homework assignments.

**3. User Interface**

We will create a new file named `homework.php` to handle the user interface for managing homework assignments. This file will include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to provide a user-friendly interface.

```php
<?php
// Include the Gibbon header
require_once 'gibbon.php';

// Include the Homework module
require_once 'Homework.php';

// Create an instance of the Homework module
$homework = new Homework($pdo);

// TODO: Implement the user interface for managing homework assignments
```

Next, let's integrate the module with GibbonEdu.

**4. Integration with GibbonEdu**

To integrate the "Homework" module with GibbonEdu, we will create a new module folder named `Homework` inside the `modules` directory of GibbonEdu. This folder will contain the necessary files for the module.

Create a new folder named `Homework` inside the `modules` directory of GibbonEdu. Inside the `Homework` folder, create the following files:

- `module.json`: A JSON file that defines the module and its properties.
- `index.php`: The entry point file for the module.

The `module.json` file should contain the following code:

```json
{
    "name": "Homework",
    "version": "1.0",
    "author": "Your Name",
    "description": "A module for posting homework assignments",
    "dependencies": {
        "gibbon": ">=20.0"
    }
}
```

The `index.php` file should contain the following code:

```php
<?php
// Redirect to the homework.php file inside the Homework module folder
header('Location: Homework/homework.php');
```

Finally, let's save the data in the same table as GibbonEdu Planner.

**5. Saving Data in the Same Table**

To save the data in the same table as GibbonEdu Planner, we will modify the `HomeworkManager` class to use the same database connection and table as GibbonEdu Planner.

Update the `HomeworkManager` class in the `Homework.php` file with the following code:

```php
class HomeworkManager {
    private $pdo;

    public function __construct($pdo) {
        $this->pdo = $pdo;
    }

    public function createHomeworkAssignment($assignment) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("
            INSERT INTO gibbonPlannerHomework (subject, dueDate, description, instructions, classID)
            VALUES (:subject, :dueDate, :description, :instructions, :classID)
        ");

        $stmt->bindValue(':subject', $assignment->subject, PDO::PARAM_STR);
        $stmt->bindValue(':dueDate', $assignment->dueDate, PDO::PARAM_STR);
        $stmt->bindValue(':description', $assignment->description, PDO::PARAM_STR);
        $stmt->bindValue(':instructions', $assignment->instructions, PDO::PARAM_STR);
        $stmt->bindValue(':classID', $assignment->classID, PDO::PARAM_INT);

        $stmt->execute();
    }

    // TODO: Implement the remaining methods
}
```

That completes the implementation of the "Homework" module for GibbonEdu.

Please note that the code provided is a basic implementation and may require further customization and error handling based on your specific requirements.
